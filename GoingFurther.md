## What have I done so far? 

I have learned about different ways of working with objects. 

I learned about **Vectors, public variables, fix update, update and late update, ways of adding force to my objects and moving objects left and right, smooth camera follow, inputs from the keyboard and the actions that take after those inputs, delta time, the order of update methods calls, more about frames per second, units per second in Unity, setup of different settings, adding scripts, adding objects to scripts, manipulating the shape of the objects, controlling the camera, as well as adding material to objects and found out information about different modelling softwares such as blender or gimp**

The Next steps I need to take: I need to model the piano and add it to the game.
